 Hi everyone today let us understand waters well know deep okay exploration under ethical hacking we have a well know of the exploitation and let us know water spell edition testing also so well know day it's nothing but flaws we can say loopholes here yeah so all you can even in a simple words you can say as weakness weakness it may be in the system okay weakness it may be in the system or it may be in your application or it may be in your network that okay so here a well know of the exploitation that means let's consider and attack here okay let's consider a black cat hacker and a white cat hacker here okay so when they focus on well know deep even black cat hacker tries to identify well know deep even in a white cat hacker tries to identify well know deep but black cat hacker always try to exploit them you know to gain unauthorized access but we ethical hackers penetration testers we always try to identify them okay but we always ensures system security so this is quite good difference between black cat hacker and a white cat hacker here okay so this comes under well know of the exploitation always he tries to check for four flaws he find flaws he conducts well know of the assessment and he tries to exploit them in order to gain unauthorized access here so these completes your well know of the exploitation part and here let's try to learn what is penetration testing okay so under penetration testing first let us know what is it so penetration testing it's a type of security testing okay so here it's a testing where it evaluates completely an organization's ability to protect the infrastructure you know in the infrastructure it may be a network it may be a application it may be any systems users information okay so the main thing is it's a security testing which evaluates organizations ability to protect these infrastructure okay such as network application systems users against external as well as internal threats it's a very effective way of determining the you know efficiency of organization security policies controls and their technologies so main thing is benefits why we need to conduct there can be a question right why we need to conduct this penetration testing benefits yeah in order to reveal well know piece to show real risk in order to ensure business continuity okay if you want to reduce client and attacks if we want to guard the reputation of the company right so these are all the benefits of penetration conducting a penetration test here okay so penetration testing is different well know of the assessment is different well know of the assessment is here we are the list he focuses on discovering the well know of this in an information system here okay but penetration testing here it's a methodological approach okay you know to do a conduct security assessment here he tries to you know focus on various methodologies you know to perform security audits well know of the audits he overall demonstrate how many severity levels are there under well know of these how actually attackers exploit you know the whole system everything will be knowing here okay so main thing is here in this penetration testing we also have so many parts okay types first is goal oriented further we have as a a rating oriented and complex oriented sorry complands oriented okay so main thing is here the job of the pen tester is to check whether she or he can achieve the goal and determine the different ways to achieve the good okay so main thing is the you know objective of this penetration penetration test test test to define rather than defining the scope of targets here they can you know gain remote access to an internal network they can do they can access domain administrator part they can create door set up and to check you know if they want to check against a website they can do it they can even gain access to a credit card information but with the permission of consent authorities so the main strategies under penetration testing the main strategies are so they are classified as a black box test okay white box and a gray box this is just a intro part okay further you'll understand what all the strategies are so main thing is here in penetration testing process we have three things first we need to define the scope okay if it comes to penetration testing process first thing is we need to define defining the scope extent of texting okay where test will be performed from who will be performing the test what will be tested everything we need to define properly and then performing it performing the penetration test here okay it almost involves gathering all information here okay so it involves testing the targeted environment such as network configuration their topology hardware software so many things here thirdly reporting and delivering the results okay so here in reporting and delivering the results here we focus on listing well-known these here categories the categorizing risk okay has high medium low almost here even we recommend for repairs if well-known these are found so this is all the penetration testing process over here okay so faces overall it has three faces again pre-attack face attack face and the post attack face so in the pre-attack face we research information gathering in attack face we do testing even exploitation sometimes in the post face we do documentation okay and the reporting part here so these are the faces of penetration testing over here the characteristics also here we need to hire a very skilled and experienced professional to perform this test okay and following the methodology we need to have a proper planning and documentation that documenting the result should be a very carefully we need to do okay and whatever the parameters we need to establish properly the limitations justification for the procedure has everything has to be announced properly here so lastly ethics of a penetration tester you will be understanding okay how to perform penetration testing with the return permission of the client and how to notify the client with the first discovery of any highly vulnerable flaws we need to maintain a degree of separation between a criminal hacker and the security professional here okay so these all things come standard your penetration testing is just a intro part so in further models here we learning about this penetration testing indeed thank you
