 Hi everyone today let's learn about session hijacking it's just a intro part so in this I would like to give you a real time example let's consider a user okay let's say user is at office and this user wants to connect to Facebook server okay so here at the victim the user is at office and he wants to log into his Facebook okay trying to connect to a Facebook server he can enter in the browser as Facebook dot com like this right but attack her okay sitting somewhere at remote location tries to hijack his application okay he sometimes hijacks it how it happens actually because attacker is somewhere sitting remotely not remote location it's not inside the network but here at office the user is trying to log into Facebook how social media applications are hijacking getting hijacked how is Facebook got hijacked here this is what the very important question which comes under session hijacking so overall session hijacking it refers to an attack okay well attacker you know it takes over a completing completely existing session it takes over a valid TCP connection communication session or it takes over an existing session here between two computers okay so we have further network level session hijacking application level okay so main thing is here attacker they tries to hijack using and if it is there are two things application level as well as network level okay in application level he tries to use the technique cross-site script attack cross-site script attack is nothing bad okay attacker tries to use a phishing page a phishing website and he tries to insert a malicious JavaScript finally this infected web page he tries to in fact you know send to a victim he tries to infect their browser and finally the overall the cross-site script attack has been influenced in order to conduct the application level session hijacking when it comes to network level okay so there are few steps where he tries to conduct the network level session hijacking also as I can tell you the example one moment so let's completely have user one here let's see how network level session hijacking occurs let's say they both are communicating through internet yeah that that means we have a complete TCP existing session between them but attacker from the middle here okay so he first try to sniff the network and he tries to observe who is host who is the user one where the message is you know getting transferred everything so overall he monitors the packet flow here between two machines okay so second thing he tries to capture the packet okay so he tries to sniff the network and he tries to capture that means he is trying to collect respective IP addresses of both here okay so capturing process sniffing comes here attacker now he tries to kill the connection between these user and user two after extracting lots of information between these two users he will try to kill the connection between user one and user two after destroying the connection he will take over the session okay so he will be take over he will be taking over the session here and now he will become a fake user okay user two things that he's a user one now he tries to behave as user one and he tries connecting to user two here sending spoof packets he tries to pretend himself as a user one and start communicating with user two and finally recover and retrieves all the details and steals specific information sensitive information regarding that organization so overall the very important steps which are he tries to monitor sniff the network he tries to monitor the packet flow he tries to capture you know packet he tries to collect as much as possible you know he tries to collect information as much as possible from the user one and user two finally he killed the connection and take over the session and he himself tries to pretend now as a user one and start communicating with user two and finally he retrieves all the sensitive details so this way network level session hijacking happens okay so let's see how it happens here in the slides so yeah overview this is all things our clients of session hijacking so we'll see this is just a intro part further in further models you will be learning about this difference between spoofing hijacking types the levels of session hijacking even we will be knowing that pulls also okay so we have a spoofing here okay and hijacking see spoofing is nothing but he himself tries to pretend okay so spoofing it's nothing but he'll just predict himself as a legitimate user and tries to conduct an attack okay there's lots of difference between spoofing and session hijacking you just can see here so session hijacking technique used by hackers in order to gain access to targets computer or their online accounts accounts anything or all in session hijacking attack a hacker takes control of users browsing session in order to gain access to their you know personal information passwords right probably anything but spoofing it is quite different spoofing attack here is nothing but you know when someone or something pretends to be something else right so here attacker he himself pretends to be someone and tries to get access in order to steal data here he's just pretending to be a legitimate user but in hijacking he overall takes over the session okay and then attack here okay yes so yeah this is all the hijacking tools we have a hijacking tools as verb sort one of the best hijacking tool okay so we also have you know prevention us main thing is we need to use anti-virus software and we need to educate the people about encryption part yeah so the best thing is manually using packet sniffing software via sharp tool we can detect it but if you use ideas and IP assistance in your you know organization definitely this attack can be mitigated so this is the end of the sniffing guys yeah so main thing is we need to protect our network we need to mitigate this using our respective countermeasures there should be not a weak session ideas so yeah let's focus on the fireball here so fireball is nothing but a barrier device between a trusted zone and trusted zone yeah so let us focus on the fireball here one moment here okay so next the awaiting ideas IPs part is that okay and is a cyber security the intro part so when I tell you about fireball it's nothing but a network security device okay so we have two things we have software firewalls we have hardware firewalls also but this fireball okay it will be always between a untrusted zone and a trusted zone let's say this is public network network one and let's say this is private network even you can name them as internet zone and intranet zone okay so between always the firewall as a barrier device it sits between you know trusted untrusted site and between trusted zone so this firewall by VR designing this firewall here so firewalls are designed in order to forward or discard packets the main thing is it is the one which allows authorized traffic okay whatever the packets whatever the ongoing traffic incoming traffic outgoing traffic we say yeah so all the data packets entering or leaving the network which passes through the fireball here okay so after examining it checks it completely filters out whether to say you know allow or discard it decides actually you know by on the basis of predefined rules or predefined rules so overall firewall is a network security system it's monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules here okay always try to remember if you want to mitigate web server attacks or if you want to mitigate web application attacks or if you want to prevent a SQL injection attack boss attack always we need a web application firewalls okay so we need a web application firewalls has to be installed in order to prevent web server attacks there should be a lot there should be an intrusion detection system there should be an intrusion prevention system so there was a drawback in a traditional network security firewalls firewalls usually checks only the TCP header part okay so they were not cross checking anything malicious the malicious content under the data so they were overall checking only the source IP destination IP the protocols and some other parameters under TCP header part so you know that from user one to user to if any data is getting transferred along with the data we have a TCP header part also so firewall was checking only the TCP header part not the data completely so hence so in this generation we have web application firewalls and ideas intrusion detection system and intrusion prevention system so ideas is just detects and monitors and modifies the network admin about the known threats and unknowns such but IPs it suddenly stops the traffic it discards there and there okay so overall it prevents the attack yeah okay so let us see in this slide so as you can see we have firewall both we have software and hardware firewalls so zone on architecture in further models you will be knowing what it is so we have two types of firewalls we have a technology yeah three types of firewalls in the main categories we have a hardware and software but when it comes to technology packet filtering circuit level application level firewalls have that so I have mentioned the limitations also so mean one of the for mean limitation of firewall is it does not you know it does not prevent password with use and seriously it cannot prevent social engineering attacks and even it won't analyze any new virus types so we have our ideas also here and further models we will be knowing what is ideas what is IPs about this okay so as we know it even checks for signatures and partner patterns and it raises an alarm okay and this is the IP system it completely one of the best tool you know best a system I can say we have a tools also but IPs is one of the network security tool the best tool which continuously monitors and even it can prevent it's just not only detecting it is preventing the attack okay so in this further model you also try to check about honey pots you'll be learning about honey pots it's nothing but a dummy device a fake device just to drop attackers and to have a earlier warning signs to check their keystrokes their activities you know to monitor and trap them use honey pots here okay so we have so many counter measures for the fire wall so overall we'll be learning the evasion techniques also under this module so here it completes your fire evading ideas fire wall IPs honey pots intro thank you
