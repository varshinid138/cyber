 Okay, shall we start the sniffing techniques? The first technique is here we have a mac flooding. What we used to do, here he used to flood the camp table with fake mac addresses. Always try to remember, camp table is nothing, but content and invisible memory. How what happens there? How it creates, how do you used to get created? Like, you know, using ARP packets, right? Like ARP address assistant protocol, it is the one which helps us to mean mapping. IP and Mac used to map, right? Using that, then we are camp table, right? So proper camp table, what attacker used to do? He used to flood with the fake mac addresses. This is what Mac flooding is, okay? So after this Mac flooding, what happens? The switch then acts as a hub, okay? So my broadcasting package to all the machines, therefore attacker can sniff the traffic easily. Getting in. So here we use Mac off tool.
