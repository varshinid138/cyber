 Yeah, TCP as we know what we know is a connection oriented protocol. It performs always remember we used to I used to tell you right segmentation segmentation this is the one which performs segmentation. It performs sequencing and segmentation of data. Remember this segmentation of data. And it also has the first one and the second one. It also has one of the best features is acknowledgement feature and controls the flow of data through mechanisms to mechanisms respective mechanisms. When retransmission occurs if packet we whatever we sending if it is not reaching to the destination if it comes back retransmission has to happen right. You remember where this one TCP points collection oriented protocol retransmission happens here and it works in non real time and then slow when you compare to UDP and it is a reliable one because it gives each and every information about the packets why it got lost why it is not received there every each and every information of the packets we are getting it and it is a reliable. Can you go with the UDP and they can ask you where actually the segmentation happens who performs it under transport layer always your segmentation happens. UDP what is the full format yes it user data gram protocol. It is what its connection less protocol and used for what applications I told you it is used for real time applications right guys. The best example which I gave is now what is up calling right.
