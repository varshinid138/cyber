 See, these are some of the tools you need to know down. SQL map we use in Kali Linux. No SQL map will see whether we use or go up to it. We need to use both for hacking web application as well as SQL injection. Apart from this, we have some of the vision techniques. Let me show you what exactly this is. This is this. See, there is something called SQL detection engine. What this engine does? Whenever you try to use these SQL commands or SQL injection to any of the website, this SQL detection engine will detect your SQL injection and you can't able to perform this SQL injection and you can't able to access the database. So, what we can do here? What are the things we can do? We can use some of the evasion techniques. What are these evasion techniques? With the help of these techniques, we can able to trick this engine or we can manipulate this engine into believing that we are not conducting SQL injection. We are giving some normal valid input only. So, how we can do that with the help of these things? What are these things? These are character encodings or URL encodings. I have shown you. See, these are the terminologies for question mark. We use percentage three for HTML entity encoding. We use this. So, these are some of the encodings we can use in order to bypass that or evade that SQL detection engine. What else we have? We have string content and catenation. Let me give you. Are you familiar with JavaScript or Java or something like that? See, what happens here? Suppose this is function. Let's give function name. See, here, what's happening? Here, something calls string concatenation. We are doing. Suppose if we give out this function and whenever we call this function, this output will return. Something like this. Hello, world will be written. Right. So, here, what we are doing? We are concatenating. If we don't give space in after this, before this double coat, if we give space, before this double coat, it will be space here. Or it will, if you don't give space here, it will look something like this. So, this is here, what we are doing? We are concatenating two different words. So, here, what we can do? We can use similar technique for SQL statement. Something like this. Post-execute. Select. Plus ECT. Plus user. US. Plus ER. So, what I am doing here? This is SQL statement, right? Select users or start from user or something like this. Here, what I am doing? I am using concatenation technique in order to evade the SQL detection engine. So, this is one of the techniques we can use to evade the detection engine. You got the idea, you know, how concatenation works. In any of the program, if you want to concatenate or join two words, you can use this plus symbol and you can extract the output. Similarly, with the help of this technique, we can evade the SQL statement or SQL injection with the help of concatenation. String concatenation of a few cases is similar to character encoding only. Then we have something called white space manipulation. See, instead of giving some space, what you can do, you should write these SQL statements like this without giving any space. If you don't give any space, lack of space, will what happen? This detection engine will not able to detect any of the signature or pattern of SQL statement. If it cannot able to detect any signature or pattern of this SQL statement, because of some lack of space, it will give us the opportunity to execute this SQL statement. So, this is one more technique we can use. So, one more thing, there is called inserting comments between keywords. See, I think you are familiar with the comments to dash. See, whatever comes after this will be ignored. So, these are the single line comment that we used in HTML. And one more multi line comment is there. Whatever you write after this double dash, it will be ignored. And whatever you write inside this also will be ignored. Like, there will be some body and you write some sentence here. This is this and you will close the body tag. Whatever you write inside this comment will be ignored. And this won't be executed. It will be considered as comment. So, this is the user you use for multi line comment. So, similar technique we use for SQL statement like union. So, what I can do, I can do this, I can do this. See, these are some of the techniques we can use to in order to evade the detection. Inserting comments between the keywords. Right. And also character encoding, string concatenation and white space manipulation. So, these are some of the vision techniques we can use to evade the detection, SQL detection engine.
