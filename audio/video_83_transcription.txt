 Then let's auto and use the hideous firewall and import solution. See this start is nothing but similar to white shark only what it does. It will monitor analyze all these packets. It will sniff the packets that is being there going on in this network and it will log all those packets. Basically we use this tool to detect different kind of variety of attacks. With the help of this tool we can able to find out if there is any malicious activity that is going on or malicious data that is being transmitting in our network. This is call-in tool only we can install this download this in the call-in and this not will have some set of rules. See if you remember our packet filtering firewall I was talking that we have some kind of rules. What are those rules? See packet filtering firewall I explained you there are some set of rules that are there in which we will determine what are the things that we need to we can set in our rules. For example we can set whether we need to allow a particular data packet which has this particular source address whether we can whether to allow that particular data packet which has that particular destination address port number protocol and all those things. All these rules we can define is not also. With the help of those rules this not will determine its action it will compare those rules and it will check whether to allow that data packet or not. So this is similar to that only apart from that's not.
