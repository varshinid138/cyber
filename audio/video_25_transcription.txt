 So, now let us discuss about this footprinting methodology before this as I told you here let us consider attacker and opposite obviously there will be a target right let me consider some organization, econ or some company here right. So, what he is trying to collect the data here he may collect all internal IP addresses information he may collect employment ID yeah he may try to collect a server information and their configuration yes sometimes he may focus also on their domain names sometimes phone numbers, g-mails and sometimes even a job ID's many more thing all this respective sensitive information right. So, overall what we can name this part. So, attacker overall these are nothing but information yeah as you know you can call them as sensitive information also but also sometimes you can refer it as critical assets. So, overall attacker collects these critical assets okay sometimes in the international exam they used to mention this okay as critical assets do not get confused under that before launching an attacker he always try to collect the critical assets here clear. So, we have a first methodology let us go with that here.
