 Ahh, transfer. With fair numbers, a processing feature with my software. I can use it on my homepage as a developer. Share the complete screen. Focus on the screen now. Screen is visible. Sagar. Yes. Sagar is recording. Say. First information gathering tool. So in under Windows platform, we studied netcraft. Smart too is thing, wireless total and okay. It's not visible. Now. Is it visible now? Okay. So guys, under Windows platform, we studied so many tools. Under Linux platform, if they ask you, which are the best information gathering tool, have this first is multi go. Yeah. So, secondly, have you registered yourself under multi go and tried? Yes. How many of you have tried? Dalabhishek, Shashwath? Yes. No, on the way. Add an avid tried. Multi go. Right. Right. Right. Three steps. Just install the Kylann. Why you guys? Why you? Okay. Check with us. So here, let me create a work spaces. Why are we creating work spaces here under Reconinj? First Reconinj is one of the best information gathering tool. We have so many models. Okay. So, we have so many models. Okay. Where hackers or ethical hackers, they, whenever they want to conduct footprinting, whenever they want to fetch some details, collect information, they're going to use that model. Okay. So, I tried to use one or two model and I'll try to show you how actually they gather information. Clear. First is work spaces. So, if I'm, let's say I'm at my room, if I'm like, I have a boardroom. For cross, as well as for my books, let's say another glass kind of water. Everything will be there. There are, you know, the hacking books, ethical hacking books, everything. So, if I don't have, particularly if I'm not maintaining in that. So, there will be books will be in some other drawers, in some other rooms. Right. There will be not proper the bundle structure. Right. So, what work spaces in order to create that, you know, whatever the listings, whatever the director is, whatever you do, it should be in some, in your hand, right in some bundle. So, what we are creating this work space. Now, next is market place search. Why am I giving this command? Market place search. Modules comes up. Destroy all the Reconnaissance modules. Understanding. So, minus installed. To install yours, what you need to do? Market place. Install all. Once you give this, it keeps on installing. Clear. Since I have installed it, I can directly search any module. Module name, let's say hacker targets. Is it installed? Verified. Right. Now, I'll try to give market place. So, since it's installed, I'll directly load this module. Modules. Load. What is the name? Hacker targets, right? So, if sometimes you have to copy this whole module name. Okay. Sometimes it won't come, but yeah, for this, I just can enter. Invalid module name. Yes, it got loaded here, right? I want to set the source now. Option set source. Let me give Google, sorry, eCon. Tech.net. Source is set. Info. Information it will showcase. Run. Info show. Run. Hacker target is the module, which helps us in fetching out. The respective subdomains along with their IP addresses. Getting guys? Yeah. No. First is. Let me show you one more page. See. What you need to do is first try to launch. First, what do you want to launch? When it comes to Recon entry. First is, what do you need to do? Work spaces. It's the first command. Create this workspace. Next, what do you want to do? Marketplace search. Properly write the commands. If you are giving a space between market and place, you'll be not getting the output. So if you give this command, what happens? So many modules comes up. So since you're using this, using it for the first time, your modules have been not been installed, right? So it is an uninstalled status. So marketplace install all. And then search it. Search the module. Marketplace search module name. Let's say hacker target. This is your module name, guys. Okay. So once you verify it is installed, you will be loading modules. Load module name. Load the module. And then please write on this command. Then set the source. Sagar Ankita, can you just see the screen? Please load it down. Yes, ma'am. Yes. Okay. Info. Show or directly you can run it. I want you to write down this command properly, so that we can try with other modules, other source also. Reconnaissance. Okay. Okay. Okay. Then guys, go on launch, launch Reconnaissance, and then whatever. No modules. So do a APT install Reconnaissance. If it is not there, then hit new built. What is notification? Search Revolving? You don't know, I can see more. Now, follow more. First open them. Okay, let me go this. You can still leave yourself. It's not too long. If you're sometimes have to watch. No, you can't. I'll just pause it. See, it's published. Finally, it's made. It's installed. Reel-on-chache. Once it is installed, cancel and then re-launch again. Where they install another Achilin, let it install. Once installation is done, exit, then re-launch again. Network connectivity is there. Goody show me again one more time. That's how it can be get open. The Recon ng. Yeah, I'll show you once again. One moment. You won't be able to launch this application once again. Let me launch it. Applications here. Recon ng. They represent, is it launched? Yes. Then wait for some time. No. Sagar, are you following me? You're not searching for a same. Okay. Just need to go for this application and Recon ng will be there here. Just in the search section, enter RE. If you're entering RE, you're going to get Recon ng. Recon ng. So create workspaces. Marketplace search. Ankita. Got it. Other modules installed. I'll let you check with some other module. This module will be there to complete. Marketplace search. Add the target. Once you confirm this has been installed, I'll try to check with Google now. Models load. Target. Option set. Source. One source is set. Directly runoff. Let us see how many subdomains we have. 17 new host. 5 not 1 total host. Right guys? See, we fetched out all the respective subdomains along with their IP addresses. Got it. What happened? Invalid session. I'm trying to search that but I built that application is not installed in the purple. 2D OPPT install this thing. Recon ng. Open a terminal in this way. Here, try to write pseudo-APT install Recon ng or multi-go anything. See, this side is showing this. See, in this way. Work in this way. If it is not there, inbuilt, try to use this command. Okay, just empty it. Show guys. I'll give you the number. Invalid session, workspaces on workspace. What are you doing? What is your number? I'm not doing it. What is your number? Option set. Option to set. Option with it. Option set. Directly runoff. What is your number? First piece is. Please render the command properly, guys. I'll just try to display this again. If you're not writing this command, it's probably going to get you. Please stay down this command. Is it going to be a good one? What is your number? Work spaces. Marketplace search. There is just a space between marketplace and search. If your borders have not the first time you're using, definitely if you can install. If you've been a sales of uninstalled, so install it. Using the command marketplace install. Once the borders are installed, go install again. It will be installed. Go to the command back. Search module name. Modules load. The particular module again. Modify. So properly check the commands. Is that so? Yes. What happened in the computer? Now, take it. We choose problem. And then stamp. That's for you. I'm going to select one. That's for what you are looking for. So why you select open, i.e его type . Okay. Let me see. It's okay. I'm not going to do that. I need to know what's nice. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Then I go to the F Wasps. Facebook crack YouTube. Facebook. Facebook- 벌. Facebook. Facebook. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. this one. this one. Res户裑裏那麼多個構, ROT känns, like, so taken to teaching, so��omie kids can walk on the streets, all of jobs can be offered to everyone. There we go. Sorry. We're waiting for newmes , we can't so far ahead please. Sagar, clear. You want to share this screen and I want to help you for that. It's okay, I installed it. I'm going for the commands now. Awesome. Then have you copied on this commands? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. That is awesome. TP link. Data mindset 123. Yes. That is awesome. TP link. Data mindset 123. Yes. D capital drive with D capital. Check his mouse. How much man? David Russell. Who gifted you? Self. Self. God. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. If it had any where the input won't have anyorse. Yes. Everyone knows. Yes. Let's take a look at the setupcam. Not a 1947 set. 1. Yes. Lets see if I can say. Wait as you sign it. Yes хочу that you, miss it too. I'm backing first. proper commands. I want to choose the modules. We have so many, see Metacrawler, who is minor, email, mail tester. These are all the modules guys. Sometimes they ask for API, okay. So whichever is not asking any API, you can just go with that. Where is OIS minor within? I want to show the Wii spot. I want to see this module. See guys, whichever is the module. Take this copy, copy the module. So here what you are going to do. If you want to check whether it is installed or not, marketplace, search, check whether it is installed or not. Focus on the screen guys, whenever I am showing something. So once I have taken another module, right Akina? It is installed. Now what you are going to do? We will be loading the module now. Why my students are very happy? Not working or working. So happy. Modules load, my God. Who copied this module? Again I have to copy my module. Okay. So it is got loaded here. Now then set the source. Then now customers change the domain. Go ready. Let's fix all the other. No, we can directly run. No customers, yeah. Netflix, you have so many. One new company, one new location, netblock. Okay. The customer and where it is the branches, they have given the complete state address, right? Yeah. Who is minor from the Wii's database? We just can fetch out the subdomains, the technical point of contact, main branch, address everything along with the IP addresses. Get it. I want you to go with some other modules and try in the Reconinchi. Clear? Okay. Now which tool you want to learn? So we'll learn with enmap, scan, or I'll finish with DNS enum. DNS Recon first recurrences tools. No, we'll finish recurrences part. DNS Recon Recon tool, guys, this is the best tool which is can use for, see, why am I using iPhone D here? They have instructed us, see, if you're using iPhone D, if you're using with range, iPhone R, if you want to enter some domain name, iPhone D and then domain name, okay. It's a recurrence tool. DNS Recon, if they ask you, how will you fetch information with respect to their servers, DNS servers. Now I'll give a task for Achillin. I'll tell completely you fetch the site report of their DNS servers of any target domain. So you can use DNS enm, DNS Recon, and fierce tool. Okay. First we'll check with DNS Recon. I want to search regarding Amazon.com. DNS Recon, iPhone D and domain name, see, their name servers, everything has been enumerated. How many things? Extracord, IP addresses, their bind versions, name servers, mail servers, everything can be enumerated. Understanding, guys, in Windows, how can you do it using nslookup? I should nslookup? No? Yes, no. Okay. So this is what is. I would also show you the verb suit. Let me launch verb suit. I had told you right. How actually? So if they ask you about verb suit, guys, see, being an ethical hacker, I can say that this verb suit has the best web application, one of these candidates. Under professional addition, we can use this tool, okay. The cracks offered, we're going to get, but in company site, they're going to give you a complete professional addition. So what happens is, can you just see this? Now it is in a lighter color. Gray, I don't have option to click on this new scan, but in professional addition, we just can use this this new scan. I can scan for the world of these. I can feature the loopholes of a target domain. When it comes to a hacker's perspective, they use this verb suit as a session hijacking tool. If they want to capture HTTP requests, they use this. See, guys, I'm a client, I was BI server. No time to visit bank and to do a transaction, right? I'll go with the internet banking. Yeah. So I'm trying to initiate connection towards SBI server. Initial request, TCP handshake. Remember client server request response acknowledgement, right? What happens here? No. There should be a communication between client and server, but verb suit, he'll try to use this as a proxy server. Always this web proxy server which will sit between client and server. It tries to capture HTTP requests. How? See, it just needs to be in the home page proxy. Start browser. Here we have browser. Try to use some, I had given some mutual bank, right? Try to launch this. Yeah. So what they're going to do, let me just intercept on. They'll try to intercept and they'll capture our thing. So let me enter some username and password. What happens, guys? Where are you log in? What is this? username password captured. Right? What's the password? I entered. I'm in. Right? So what happens when? See, it's not forwarded to server. If you want to conduct good force attack, he'll further forward this too. So many things. He can capture the session ideas. So we have Intruder. He can forward here. We have sequencer, collaborator. It's a framework, guys. We have bunch of tools here. If you want to hijack cookies, he'll go with the sequencer and he'll try to capture cookies. Clear. Now I want to show you this. What happened? It was captured here, right? User name password. Yeah. He'll try to capture our user name password and he can replace my number again with his number and standing. He'll completely edit this issue to be request. If he's editing his number, like my number, completely replacing my number with his number, how come server will come to know that somebody has changed the number? Server duty is to send the OTP to that particular phone number. Yeah. If he is modifying the content of the message and then forwarding to server. What happens? OTP goes to home. Hacker, so what? To bypass OTPs, to capture your user name password, your session ideas, he's using this Babsoot as a proxy server, which sits between WebCline and Web browser and is capturing our data and he can further modify the content also or HTTP request. He's playing with our HTTP request. He's playing with our OTPs, understanding. So after finishing session hijacking module, I'll try to show you in detail how the attacks happens here. Okay. So I want you to take the testing domain intercept on, use the Bob browser. Okay. Whatever you use, it will capture by the Bob browser there. Google launched interceptors on, see, still loading. Interceptors on, no. Yeah. Should not allow. Once it's all seen. Yeah, host, cookies, session IDs, everything came up. See, it got launched here, but where he is capturing under his homepage, Bob Soot. Getting started, Ankita. Yeah, man. Yeah. So for now, you have to remember this, Bob Soot, one of the best tools which we have under colonel in us. Okay. So here under Bob Soot, we, validation testers, we are self-ethical hackers. We use it for scanning here, scan the world of these software domain. It's the best web application world of these scanners, but hackers perspective is different. He uses this to hijack the session to hijack cookies to capture live cookies to grab cookies, you know, session IDs to capture our capture our user name passwords and to bypass OTPs. They can ask you any bunch of scenarios during interviews. Clear with the tools. Yeah. So we studied Recon. Multigo is done. I can, we can just work with that again in that utilization. Please register logging and let me know prepare with your screenshots. I can ask you tomorrow with the multi go. I need the output there. Okay. Multigo, a CT kit to create a phishing page and Bob Soot session hijacking tool and what else? Recon in G. Right guys? Four tools done. Any doubts? Yes, adding? Any doubts? The thinking in there? Yes. Santosh, get out there. Load out. Sagar and Gita, cleared? Yeah. Okay. So tomorrow's assessment is please work with Bob Soot and Recon in G and cyber forensic. Okay. Try to analyze the email header part and help me with the IP and there after go to IP location.io and trace this identity. Okay. So today almost week went with practical class. Right. Maintain the tools list. How much ever we are finishing. I can ask you anytime. How many tools has been done in this class? Maintain tools list always. Clear. Okay. So tomorrow we'll finish footprinting. We'll jump into scanning. How to scan and how to check for ports. How ports scanning we can conduct both under Windows and Linux. Yeah. Everything will be checking. Clear guys? Clear, Adam? Yes. Which one? It comes in a session. I'm checking module. It's in level two. Yeah. So what will go in depth there? I will be giving assessments. I will be helping you with interior section. You help you with the sequencer. We can prepare a project there. So students they used to have a testing the mind. They have you know bypass roti-free-susing is one of the best project. I'll be teaching what is the absolute what are all the tools we have in that everything is just an introduction since we are in the footprinting add-in. Okay. Anything else guys? I try to show you one more tool. I want you to work with enmap. Enmap. Enmap network map. The best tool. Okay. So it's a network scanning tool. If they ask you which is the best tool for network scanning? Enmap where we can have port discovery, host discovery. We can check for ports, live machines, even we can check for what. Services running in the network. Okay. If you want to scan enmap then just give the domain name. So where you're going to get the you know I'm closing this verb suit. Let me exit this and I want to show you the cheat sheet of enmap where please come please read this cheat sheet also. It's creating is not visible. Why so? Oh I have stopped the share. Okay. So, I just went with this applications again. We have enmap here which is a network best network scanning tool. Okay. So here I just scan the domain. Amazon domain. Enmap domain name. Clear. So I was helping them with the cheat sheet. This is the best cheat sheet. I try to provide you guys in the chat section also. Station X we're going to get the cheat sheet of 2020 Ford. Chat section. So guys see here if you want to. Okay. Can search for the cheat. If you are scanning a single IP enmap IP address. If you're scanning specific IPs yes you can. Space should be there. Then if you are scanning a whole range yes this is what the command is. So I am scanning the domain name right. Domined enmap Amazon.com. And then if you want to use the CIDR notation yes you can. Okay. See if you are want to scan a target using a file from a file yes you can. Randomly if you want to scan 100 random host yes. If you want to exclude some of the host yes you can. I want you to work with this command center the enmap. Clear. So after this we'll go with next level scanning. What is TCP scan? How do you know discover ports, ports scanning, how to do that? Everything will check. See if you want to include port range enmap iphone p if you want to scan this port 21 and then IP address. So we'll go in detail regarding this just have a look of cheat sheet and try to use three four commands under enmap okay. So I'll try to show you this see I use the domain name what happened guys host is up right it's not a dead website yeah and then how many ports got 998 okay this got not scanned how many ports are open 80 and 443 getting so to check their OS which is the command how to conduct TCP connect scan acknowledgement scan is to check the presence of fireball how to do this all enmap well enough to also you can check using an enmap command you can bypass fireball using enmap you have so many things under enmap okay so one of the best network scanning tourists your enmap after your thing okay so we have angry if it's kind of proxy switcher also comes under scanning we'll check tomorrow okay please practice recon ng cyber forensic and then verb so clear any doubts is it clear now and get the staggered yeah okay tomorrow we'll finish up the footprinting well check with the scanning what happens and a scanning okay we'll go through all the types of scanning and then we'll jump into the practical part so yes almost will be completing scanning yeah and then we can have a mock one next week okay so I'll try to so your phones acts everything should be here on the laptop and your mock assessment is just for 30 months we'll check how much you're preparing okay so you'll be getting this Friday Saturday Sunday right three days you can prepare for introduction to ethical hacking footprinting and scanning just starting models 30 marks just so questions will be from international people easy concert people start a chat GP equations at all okay yeah clear fine thank you thank you all will see you tomorrow okay
